# Welcome to DisCap!
We are a small Captcha Service based out of New York, USA.
DisCap is a captcha service designed to protect websites from automated spam and abuse by verifying that the user is a real human and not a computer program.
DisCap generates a challenge in the form of a Hidden JavaScript Challenge.
By the browser completing the challenge, the user proves they are not a bot and gains access to the website's content or services.
DisCap's captcha solution is easy to use, secure, and effective at preventing automated attacks on websites.

# Where are our repositories?
DisCap's main code is private! However, we have forked projects that we use mainly and that we are editing to make better for our use-case.
